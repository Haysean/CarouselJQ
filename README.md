CarouselJq
==========

A simple and easy to implement JQuery carousel, designed with responsive frameworks in mind.

CarouselJQ is a bare bones carousel I initially developed to allow easy implementation with the Skeleton responsive boilerplate by Dave Gamache (http://www.getskeleton.com/). However, its just as easy to implement with any web development project.

CarouselJQ is a very basic carousel intended to be further developed according to your projects necessities. It works very well as a quick install carousel with simple straightforward coding.
